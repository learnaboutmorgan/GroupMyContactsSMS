This is my contribution to the application I was making with my team during MHacks 6. MHacks 6 was my very first hackathon ever!
I was just barely a first-year student, had finished my gap year less than 6 months ago. I was in my CS 101 class but bold
enough to believe that I could do something in an event called a hackathon. My CS background was minimal but I found a supporting
team and friends who mentored me during this time. This is where my love for hackthons spurred and hasn't stopped since.
